# **Guess My Number Game**

Welcome to the **Guess My Number** game! This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The goal is to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## **How to Play**

1. The game will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
2. You need to guess the number by entering your guess.
3. After each guess, you will receive feedback:
    - **"Too low"** if your guess is more than 10 numbers below the target.
    - **"Low, but you're close"** if your guess is within 10 numbers below the target.
    - **"Too high"** if your guess is more than 10 numbers above the target.
    - **"High, but you're close"** if your guess is within 10 numbers above the target.
4. Every 5 guesses, you will be offered a hint. If you accept the hint, the program will display a range within which the target number lies.
5. The game continues until you guess the correct number.
6. After correctly guessing the number, you will be asked if you want to play again. If you type **"yes"**, the game restarts with a new random number. If you type **"no"**, the game ends.
